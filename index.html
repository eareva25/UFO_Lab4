        <h1>UFO</h1>

        <p>
            News coverage of <a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0054/4525586.pdf"> UFO in 1966 </a> were explained as “college student pranks, balloons, stars, or air crafts.” This explanation of the UFO phenomenon covered by the media did not satisfy House Republican Leader Gerald, R. Ford. Mr.Ford having political power was able to file a petition to get the right investigators into the matter and give the American people a congruent answer to the UFO sightings.
